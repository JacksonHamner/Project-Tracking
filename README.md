# Project Tracking

This application is to track projects, tasks and the time employees spend working on each task.

*	Project information includes project name, description and status (pending, underway, delayed, and completed), start date, end date, and project manager.

*	Projects are made up of tasks. Each task is part of a project, and has a name, description, start date, end date, and status (pending, underway, delayed, completed).

*	Employee information includes name, title, and employee ID. Any employee can manage a project. All employees can work on tasks.

*	Employees work on tasks; information needed includes which task, which employee, date, and hours worked.

Employees (including managers) need to be able to enter their name, select a project, select a task, and enter the date and number of hours spent working on that task. Employees should only be able to select from projects and tasks that are designated as underway. Employees should also have the ability to change the time spent on a specific roject for a particular day; a task should have only one entry per employee per day.

Managers need to be able to enter/edit employees, projects and associated tasks, and change project and task status. Managers also need to be able to view information in several ways (using forms).
